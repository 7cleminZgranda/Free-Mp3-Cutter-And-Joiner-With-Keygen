Use webpack to generate your static bundles without django's staticfiles or opaque wrappers.


Django webpack loader consumes the output generated by [webpack-bundle-tracker](https://github.com/owais/webpack-bundle-tracker) and lets you use the generated bundles in django.

A [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is also available.


## Compatibility

Test cases cover Django>=2.0 on Python>=3.5. 100% code coverage is the target so we can be sure everything works anytime. It should probably work on older version of django as well but the package does not ship any test cases for them.


## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-tracker

pip install django-webpack-loader
```

## Migrating from version < 1.0.0

In order to use `django-webpack-loader>=1.0.0`, you must ensure that `webpack-bundle-tracker@1.0.0` is being used on the JavaScript side. It's recommended that you always keep at least minor version parity across both packages, for full compatibility.

This is necessary because the formatting of `webpack-stats.json` that `webpack-bundle-tracker` outputs has changed starting at version `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Starting at `django-webpack-loader==1.0.0`, this is the only formatting accepted here, meaning that other versions of that package don't output compatible files anymore, thereby breaking compatibility with older `webpack-bundle-tracker` releases.


## Configuration

### Configuring `webpack-bundle-tracker`
Before configuring `django-webpack-loader`, let's first configure what's necessary on `webpack-bundle-tracker` side. Update your Webpack configuration file (it's usually on `webpack.config.js` in the project root). Add the following lines to the file:

```javascript
var path = require('path');
var webpack = require('webpack');
var BundleTracker = require('webpack-bundle-tracker');

module.exports = {
  context: __dirname,
  entry: './assets/js/index',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve('./assets/webpack_bundles/'),
    filename: "[name]-[hash].js"
  },
  plugins: [
    new BundleTracker({filename: './webpack-stats.json'})
  ],
}
```

The configuration above expects the `index.js` (the app entrypoint file) to live inside the `/assets/js/` directory (this guide going forward will assume that all front-end related files are placed inside the `/assets/` directory, with the different kinds of files arranged within its subdirectories).

The generated compiled files will be placed inside the `/assets/webpack_bundles/` directory and the file with the informations regarding the bundles and assets (`webpack-stats.json`) will be stored in the project root.

### Compiling the front-end assets

Generally, `webpack-bundle-tracker` is used as part of an already existing build pipeline that is provided by a front-end framework/library, such as React.

However, if you wish to compile the files by yourself, you can do so by running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js --watch`. We do so on our examples, which you can check out by going [here](https://github.com/django-webpack/django-webpack-loader/tree/master/examples).

### Configuring the settings file
First of all, add `webpack_loader` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  ...
  'webpack_loader',
  ...
)
```

Below is the recommended setup for the Django settings file when using `django-webpack-loader`.

```python
WEBPACK_LOADER = {
  'DEFAULT': {
    'CACHE': not DEBUG,
    'STATS_FILE': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'webpack-stats.json'),
    'POLL_INTERVAL': 0.1,
    'IGNORE': [r'.+\.hot-update.js', r'.+\.map'],
  }
}
```

For that setup, we're using the `DEBUG` variable provided by Django when bootstraping a new project. Since in a production environment (`DEBUG = False`) the files won't constantly change, we can safely cache the results and optimize our flow by only fetching the files once.

During development, when files change a lot, we want to always poll for the updated files (in our case, we'll fetch the files every 0.1s, as defined on `POLL_INTERVAL`).

`django-webpack-loader` will look for the output file produced by `webpack-bundle-tracker`. Since on Webpack we've named it `webpack-stats.json` and stored it on the project root, we must replicate that setting on the back-end side.

`IGNORE` is a list of regular expressions. If a file generated by Webpack matches one of the expressions, the file will not be included in the template.

## Rendering
In order to render the front-end code into the Django templates, we use the `render_bundle` template tag.

Its behavior is to accept a string with the name of an entrypoint from the stats file (in our case, we're using `main`) and it'll proceed to include all files under that entrypoint. You can read more about the entrypoints concept [here](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/).

> You can also check an example on how to use multiple `entry` values [here](https://github.com/django-webpack/django-webpack-loader/tree/master/examples/code-splitting).

Below is the basic usage for `render_bundle` within a template.

```HTML+Django
{% load render_bundle from webpack_loader %}

{% render_bundle 'main' %}
```

That will render the proper `<script>` and `<link>` tags needed in your template.

### Rendering by file extension

`render_bundle` also takes a second argument which can be a file extension to match. This is useful when you want to render different types for files in separately. For example, to render CSS in head and JS at bottom we can do something like this,

```HTML+Django
{% load render_bundle from webpack_loader %}

<html>
  <head>
    {% render_bundle 'main' 'css' %}
  </head>
  <body>
    ....
    {% render_bundle 'main' 'js' %}
  </body>
</head>
```

### Using preload
The `is_preload=True` option in the `render_bundle` template tag can be used to add `rel="preload"` link tags.

```HTML+Django
{% load render_bundle from webpack_loader %}

<html>
  <head>
    {% render_bundle 'main' 'css' is_preload=True %}
    {% render_bundle 'main' 'js' is_preload=True %}

    {% render_bundle 'main' 'css' %}
  </head>

  <body>
    {% render_bundle 'main' 'js' %}
  </body>
</html>
```

## Running the project
We must run both back-end and front-end projects to fully utilize `django-webpack-loader` and `webpack-bundle-track`. For the Webpack pipeline, please refer to [this section](#compiling-the-front-end-assets).

Regarding the Django part, it should be run as a regular project.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage in production

## Code splitting

## Hot reload
In case you wish to enable hot reload for your project using `django-webpack-loader` and `webpack-bundle-tracker`, please check out [this example](https://github.com/django-webpack/django-webpack-loader/tree/master/examples/hot-reload), in particular how [server.js](https://github.com/django-webpack/django-webpack-loader/blob/master/examples/hot-reload/server.js) and [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/django-webpack/django-webpack-loader/blob/master/examples/hot-reload/webpack.config.js) are configured.
